              We and our business partners collect information about your use of

            </p>
            <p className=''>
              The cookies we and our business partners use on this website are
              broadly grouped into the following categories:.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Essential</strong> - Some of the cookies on our website
              are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you
              have requested. An example of this would be a cookie used to
              enable you to log into your account on the website or which allows
              communication between your browser and the website. Our cookie
              preference cookie described in the section “How can I reject or
              opt out of receiving cookies?” is also an essential cookie. You
              may not be able to use our website without these cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Analytics</strong> - We use analytics cookies to helps us
              understand how users engage with our website. An example is
              counting the number of different people coming to our website or
              using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times
              the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, if you visited
              the website once each week for three weeks we would count you as
              three separate users. We would find it difficult to analyse how
              well our website was performing and improve it without these
              cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Cookies</strong> - We use cookies to improve your
              experience by remembering your preferences so we know how you like
              to use our website. Examples of this would be remembering you so
              that you are served with the same content or to remember you when
              you come back to the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Social Sharing</strong> - We use third party cookies to
              allow you to share content directly on the social
              networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter or Google+.
              Examples would be if you wanted to “like” or “tweet” about us or
              our products or services. Please see our “Third Party Cookies”
              section below for more details.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> - You will have
              noticed that when you visit websites you will be shown adverts for
              products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by
              website owners for showing third party adverts on their websites
              often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore
              usually allows you to use the website without having to pay a
              registration or usage fee. To try and ensure that the adverts you
              see are relevant to you third party cookies may be used to collect
              information about the types of things that interest you, for
              example websites you visit and the geography that you are based
              in. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts
              you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more
              relevant. Please see our “Third Party Cookies” section below for
              more details.
            </p>
